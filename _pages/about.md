Hello! I am a second-year M.S. student in the **Electrical and Computer Engineering Department** at **University of California, Los Angeles** (UCLA). Before that, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Optoelectronics Information Science and Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2021. I ranked 2/134 in my major and graduated with honor both in UESTC and Sichuan Province, China.

During my undergraduate, I worked closely with Prof. Zhao Wang on optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems. At UCLA, I developed strong interests and built a solid basis in machine learning and optimization. My current research interests generally lie in **computational imaging, inverse problems, and optimization**. I play with optics and Fourier analysis, and enjoy integrating hardware design with computational methods such as deep learning.
