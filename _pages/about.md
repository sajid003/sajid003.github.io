Hello! I am a recent graduate student from ECE department, **North South University**. Currently, I am working under [Assoc. Prof. Md. Shahriar Karim](https://ece.northsouth.edu/~shahriar.karim/) on automatic image cropping and under [Asst. Prof. Mohammad Shifat-E-Rabbi](https://sites.google.com/view/m-shifat-e-rabbi/home) on out-of-distribution detection.


My current research interests lie in **image processing, computational imaging and out-of-distribution detection**. Outside the studies, I like to do cycling and travelling.
