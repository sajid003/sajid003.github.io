Hello! I am now a 1st-year PhD student in the ECE department at **Purdue University**, working under [Prof. Stanley Chan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html).

- Bio

Before becoming a Boilermaker, I obtained an M.S. degree in ECE from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2023 and a bachelor's degree in Optoelectronics Information Science and Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2021. At UCLA, I designed deep neural networks to detect AI-generated fake videos. During my undergraduate, I worked closely with Prof. Zhao Wang on optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems.

My current research interests lie in **computational imaging, inverse problems, and optimization**. Outside the lab, I intend to become a street basketball player.
